A branch in git is where you want to work on a project without interfering with the work
being done on the project - it branches off the state of the files at a particular
commit. You can then work on those files, isolated from the master branch and in no danger of your changes and commits
serious screwing up its functionality, and interfering with the work of other people. It's a good idea to
merge changes from the master branch (using pull from the upstream and then a merge) as you're working to ensure
that your changes are compatible with what's being changed there while you're branched off. Then, finally, you
merge your branch back into the master, putting the work you've done in your master (which you then push back upstream for everyone to use).
